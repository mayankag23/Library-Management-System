### Library-Management-System
main.cpp is the main code file. You have to run main.cpp to look at my library management system program. Hint: For linux users, you can use command - "g++ main.cpp" and then "./a.out" in the terminal opened in the folder containing this file.

When the code runs, it will ask for input at different stages of execution. For example- When you just enter the program, it asks wheather you want to log in as student, professor or librarian or want to exit the system.

At first there is no user except the librarian, so you have to login as librarian. Enter 3. Then enter username as "IndranilSir" and password as "IsGreat".

Then you would have variety of options as librarian like view all books, add or update both books and users. Only the librarian has admin power and can add, update and delete users and books.

For a test run, Add some books by following the instructions. e.g. Book1: Title - Harry Potter Author - J.K Rowling ISBN - 9780747532743 Publication - Bloomsbury Publishing

  **Book2:	Title - Book2**
		Author - TheAuthor
		ISBN - 9780747532881
		Publication - AnyPublication
Add some users of both type, students and professors. e.r. Student: Name- Akshunya User id - akshunyav password - password

Now you can use other functionalities like update, delete, list, search and much more. Now log out and log into some account you made before. Now you can use functionalities of students and professors like- issue,list issued books, search, calculate fine, etc.

Note- Don't forget to exit the program when you quit. Don't quit the program in between running of code.
